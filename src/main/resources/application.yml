The provided code does not appear to be Java code but instead a configuration file in YAML format. This configuration is commonly used for Spring Boot applications.

To upgrade the code to be compatible with Java 17, you don't need to make any changes to this configuration file. Configuration files are not tied to specific Java versions and can be used as is.

If you have any Java code files that you would like to upgrade, please provide them, and I will be happy to assist you in upgrading them to Java 17.
