The given Java code appears to be written in Java 8.

Here's the modified code compatible with Java 17, incorporating new language features, standards, and best practices:

```java
package com.UST.departmentservice.model;

import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import jakarta.persistence.Id;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Entity
public class Department {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long departmentId;
    private String departmentName;
    private String departmentAddress;
    private String departmentCode;
}
```

In the modified code:
- The package directive remains the same.
- Updated the imports to use the `jakarta.persistence` package instead of `javax.persistence`. This is because starting from Java EE 8, the package `javax.persistence` has been replaced with `jakarta.persistence`.
- Refactored the class and variable names to follow Java naming conventions.
- No changes were required for the annotations and data Lombok annotations.

Note: If you are using any other files, please provide the code for those files as well for a complete upgrade to Java 17.
